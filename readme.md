# Vader

This project was originally an idea to simplify debugging and environment validation for developers and teams. After some brainstorming, we settled on the name **Vader**â€”not just because it sounds cool, but because it brings order to the chaos of debugging environments.

Vader is a **self-hostable, open-source tool** for automating **environment checks, system inspections, and debugging workflows**. The goal is to help developers and teams quickly verify their setup and generate structured logs without manual intervention.

With Vader, senior engineers can **define diagnostic scripts**, and junior engineers or contributors can execute them with a single command to **collect system information, validate dependencies, and debug faster**.
